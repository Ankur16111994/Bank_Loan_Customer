The Research Conducted a quantitative analysis on data .and dataset gotten from EXCELR
 
Project Overview: 
 This is Bank loan of Customers project where we were provided with 2 datasets with .csv extension files having 39k rows each and the objective was to analyze the growth that bank got within given years in loans.

This is Banking dataset of loan status. Its features allows viewing loan Status from multiple IDs : Loan status, loan amount, last payment date, Loan Issue date , Home ownership ,Grade & Sub-grade, interest rate

We used MS-Excel, MySQL for analyzing, cleaning and removing duplicates from dataset and prepared dashboard using Tableau and PowerBI tools where we did calculations, merging and prepared interactive dashboards.

KPI's
â˜‘Year wise loan amount Stats
â˜‘.Grade and sub grade wise revol_bal
â˜‘ Total Payment for Verified Status Vs Total Payment for Non Verified Status
â˜‘ State wise and month wise loan status
â˜‘ Home ownership Vs last payment date stats

Key Insights :
We can reduce the rate of interest in some of the states where number of customers is very low so that the number of customers can increase.

Once number of customers gets increased at a certain limit where bank will not get in loss. We can slightly increase the rate of interest so that bank will generate a good revenue from the interest.

grade` AÂ´ to grade `BÂ´ it move upwards after grade B it moves diminishing till Grade `GÂ´.

The bank should increase the count of verified members as now not verified customers are maximum as compared to verified customers
 that is verified members = 22.80 K & Not verified = 16.92 K

If the bank increase the rate of interest for not verified members, then the not verified members automatically shifted to verified members
